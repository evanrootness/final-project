# Astro 416 Final Project

My final project for ASTRO 416, in which I use several supervised models (decision trees, random forests, SVMs, and GMMs) to classify globular star clusters.

All of the secions of my project including the introduction, approach, initial and final results, and reflection are included in final-project-notebook.ipynb, and the data necessary for the notebook is all included in the "data" folder.
